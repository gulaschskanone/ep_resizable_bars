ep_resizable_bars (under construction)
=======

* supports ep_table_of_contents (moved to the left to not overlap with chat bar)


## todo ##
* if page view isn't activated 
	* need fix (two scrollbars)
	* nice to have rounded corners
* need full support for ep_page_view (background-color, overlay right on small screens etc.)
* need fix, if ep_table_of_contents isn't installed (maybe detect it and switch off)
* nice to have a TOC titlebar like "Chat" 
* need resizable chat and user bar
* test with ep_comments_page
